Howdy y'all,

This is my CAD tool for taking photographs of a mask ROM and
extracting the bits, so that the contents of the ROM can be recovered.

The keyboard shortcuts in this tool are *not* optional.  Please read
the GUI documentation below before starting to explore.

If you find this tool to be useful, please buy a copy of my book on
[Microcontroller
Exploits](https://www.amazon.com/Microcontroller-Exploits-Travis-Goodspeed/dp/1718503881)
for yourself or a clever student.

## Building

This tool works in Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and MacOS, using QT6 with
the QtCharts extension.

Building the tool is easiest from the CLI.  In Debian Bullseye (11.x),
```
% sudo apt install make gcc g++ cmake git qt6-base-dev libqt6charts6-dev \
qt6-translations-l10n linguist-qt6 qt6-l10n-tools qt6-tools-\* qt6-image-formats-plugins \
libreadline-dev qt6-declarative-dev
% git clone https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/maskromtool/
...
% cd maskromtool
% git submodule init
% git submodule update --remote
...
% mkdir build; cd build
% cmake ..
% make -j 8 && sudo make install
```

In Windows and macOS, use the [Qt for Open
Source](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss) installer, being
sure to include the Charts and Image Formats extensions.  Then open
`CMakeLists.txt` as a project.  `Ctrl+B` will then compile
`maskromtool`.  If you have a problem with your import, such as
choosing the wrong Qt installation, delete `CMakeLists.txt.user` and
reopen the project to try again.

For the convenience of Windows and macOS users, we have also made some
[Prebuilt
Releases](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/maskromtool/releases).
On macOS, you might need to run 'xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine *` if
you get warnings about the signature not being recognized.


To install on macOS, first install XCode, [Homebrew](https://brew.sh),
and [Qt for Open Source](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss),
which sadly requires an account.  After that, you can open
`CMakeLists.txt` in QT Creator or use the release script to build.
(Edit the script if its Qt version is older than yours.)

```
% ./buildrelease-macos.sh
... (ignore errors about signing
% open release/maskromtool.app
```

You can also build it without the official Qt installer or App,
through Homebrew alone.  This is roughly like what we'd do in Linux.

```
% brew install cmake emacs qt
% git submodule init
% git submodule update --remote
...
% mkdir build; cd build
% cmake ..
% make -j 8 && sudo make install
```

## GUI Usage

First use File/Open ROM to open a ROM image as a photograph.  Try to
use uncompressed formats, but beware that macOS doesn't like TIFF
files.

Holding the control key (command on macOS) while rolling the mouse
wheel will zoom in and out.  You can also pinch-zoom on a track pad.
Dragging with the middle button will pan, or scroll with two fingers
as your operating system likes.

By arbitrary convention, the bits should be in long columns with shorter
rows.  If decoder lines are visible, they ought to be at the top of
the image.  Feel free to photograph it one way, then rotate it for
markup.

When you save your project, the image's filename will be extended with
`.json`.  This sorted and indented JSON file should be appropriate for
use in version control, such as Git repositories.

These keyboard buttons then provide most of your input.  For drawing
lines, first click once to choose as start position and then press the
key when the mouse is above the end position.  Deleting an item or
Setting its position will apply to the most recently placed line,
unless you drag a box to select a line.

Select an item by dragging over it with a left mouse click and
watching for it to turn green.  The most recently placed item is
automatically selected.  Some commands work on multiple selected
items; others just one.

You can delete a mistake with `D` or adjust its position a little with
`S`, the arrow keys, or a right-click drag.  During movement the bits
of unrelated lines might be hidden for performance, and the `M` key or
releasing the right mouse button will redraw them.


On macOS, `^` means Command instead of Ctrl.

```
Tab         -- Show/Hide bits.
\           -- Show/Hide rows and columns.
^\          -- Show/Hide background.
ALT \       -- Show/Hide crosshair.


R           -- Draw a row from the last left-click position.
SHIFT R     -- Repeat the last row.
C           -- Draw a column from the last left-click position.
SHIFT C     -- Repeat the last column.
SPACE       -- Repeat the last row or column.

^X ^C ^V    -- Cut, Copy and Paste.
D           -- Delete the selected objects.
SHIFT D     -- Duplicate the selected lines.
S           -- Set the selected object to the mouse position.
F           -- Jump to the selected item.
ARROWS      -- Move the selected items.

right-drag  -- Move the selected items. (SHIFT or ^)
middle-drag -- Pan the view.
^ wheel     -- Zoom.

Q           -- Zoom to zero.
A           -- Zoom in.
Z           -- Zoom out.
H           -- Jump to home position.
^H          -- Set the home position.


SHIFT F     -- Force a bit's value. (Again to flip.)
SHIFT A     -- Force a bit's ambiguity.  (Again to flip.)

M           -- Remark all of the bits.
SHIFT M     -- Update hex decoding and disassembly.
V           -- Run the Design Rule Checks.
SHIFT V     -- Clear the DRC violations.
E           -- Jump to next violation.

^Z          -- Undo
SHIFT ^Z    -- Redo

^S          -- Save changes.
```

When you first begin to mark bits, the software won't yet know the
threshold between a one and a zero.  You can configure this with
`View` / `Choose Bit Threshold`.

Even the best bits won't all be perfectly marked, so use `SHIFT+F` to
force bit values where you see that the software is wrong.  `SHIFT+A`
is similar, and marks a bit as being ambiguous or damaged.  The `DRC`
menu contains Design Rule Checks that will highlight problems in your
project, such as weak bits or broken alignment.

If placing many lines becomes tedious, select a group with your left
mouse button and duplicate the entire set with `SHIFT+D`.  You can
then drag it with the right mouse button to the new position, leaving
another copy in the original position.  If the framerate drops for
this, use the `TAB` key to temporarily hide all bits, which greatly
speeds up moving many lines in dense areas.

The crosshairs will adjust themselves to your most recently placed row
and column.  This should let them tilt a little to match the reality
of your photographs.

After you have marked the bits and spot checked that they are accurate
with DRC, run File/Export to dump them into ASCII for parsing with
other tools, such as [GatoROM](GATOREADME.md),
[Bitviewer](https://github.com/SiliconAnalysis/bitviewer) or
[ZorRom](https://github.com/SiliconAnalysis/zorrom).


## CLI Usage

In addition to the GUI, this tool has a command line interface that
can be useful in scripting.  Use the `--help` switch to see the latest
parameters, and the `--exit` switch if you'd prefer the GUI not stay
open for interactive use.

```

```

To run without a GUI, pass `-platform offscreen`.  If the program
crashes under Wayland, force Xorg usage by passing `-platform xcb`.

On Windows, it's awkward for an executable to have a GUI while
retaining a log on the CLI.  We solve this by producing two
executables; please use `maskromtool.exe` for the GUI and
`maskromtoolcli.exe` for the CLI.

A separate executable, `gatorom`, wraps the ROM bit decoder without
the graphics.  See [GatoROM](GATOREADME.md) for details.

## High Level Design

I've designed the GUI around a `QGraphicsScene`.  The underlying data
objects use the QT coordinate system, with floats for
better-than-pixel precision.

After loading a ROM photograph, the user places Columns and Rows onto
the photograph.  Every intersection of a Column and a Row is
considered to be a Bit, and a configurable color threshold determines
the value of that Bit.  Where the photograph is misread, you can also
Force the bit to a known value.

Once all of the Bits have been marked and the Threshold chosen, the
software will mark every light bit as Blue (0) and every dark bit as
Red (1).  These bits are then Aligned into linked lists of rows for
export as ASCII, for use in other tools.

To identify errors, a set of Design Rule Checks (DRC) will critique
the open project.  While the primary interface is the GUI, a CLI is
also available for scripting and testing.

## Correcting Bit Errors

While a few thousand bits might be marked without an error, larger
projects will inevitably need to manage their mistakes.

A good start is to use the DRC checks and careful configuration of the
bit thresholds until no obvious errors remain.  Then navigate the
project and hit the `tab` key to show and hide the annotations, making
sure that each bit is recognized properly.

When that is insufficient, such as for ROMs that are tens or hundreds
of kilobits, it helps to annotate the same ROM multiple times,
preferably from different photographs.  Bit errors will happen in
annotating each photograph, of course, but they will happen in
different places.  You can then use the `--diff-ascii` feature against
the output of `--export-ascii` to compare images, reconciling their
differences until all of your project files agree.

## Sampling Algorithms

Most ROMs can be read simply by reading the color of a single pixel at
the bit's center.  For those, the `Default` sampling algorithm will
work just fine.

![Normal ROM Bits](screenshots/darkbits.png)

For diffusion ROMs whose bits have been a little too delayered, the
center of the bit does not have a unique color, but it is surrounded
by slightly darker lines.  The `Wide` algorithm will take the darkest
color in each channel after sampling its size worth of bits in width,
and `Tall` does the same but vertically.

![Diffusion ROM Bits](screenshots/diffusion.png)

## Development

Patches and improvements to Mask ROM Tool are most welcome, but please
do not spam the issue tracker with feature requests.  Pull requests
should be submitted through the Github page, and they should not
entangle the project with dependencies upon third-party libraries.

The code is written in a conservative dialect of C++, with minimal use
of advanced features.  I've tried to comment the code and the class
definitions thoroughly.


## ROM Decoders

[GatoROM](GATOREADME.md) is included as a command line decoder that
solves for bit arrangements.  Please see its own README file for CLI
documentation, particularly for the solver methods that are not yet
supported in the GUI.

Separately, GatoROM is used as a library for decoding within the
MaskRomTool GUI.  Use Edit/Decoding to define the decoding style and
View/HexPreview to see a live decoding of the bits to hexadecimal.

![Screenshot of MYK82 decoding.](screenshots/decoder.png)

From the decoder, you can highlight hex bytes and use View/Highlight
Hex Selection to visualize the selected bytes.  Here we see the first
three words of the [MYK82
ROM](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/myk82rom), which pack 32 bits
into each position.  Most disassemblers operate through the CLI path,
but [GoodASM](https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/goodasm) is
statically linked.

![Screenshot of selected first three MYK82 words.](screenshots/selection.png)

A scripted solver is also supported, in which simple masks or Yara
rules describe the expected firmware.  All matches are enumerated, and
by jumping between them you can quickly decipher images that do not
use interleving, row reversal, or other complications.
